This is a simple android app which logs into your facebook account and prints out user's name under the login button once user is logged in.

It has 2 buttons - 
1. Update Status - work pending
2. Post Image - work pending

## How to make it work
Go to developers.facebook.com, get an app id, put that value in strings.xml file. Using android studio, run the app on your emulator.
